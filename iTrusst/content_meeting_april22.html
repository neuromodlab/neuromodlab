    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        The main topic was the report of the Safety working group on skull transmission and derating approaches, led by Jean-Francois Aubry. An informed approach to TUS intensity derating can help us to (conservatively) assess the safety of TUS protocols, based on stimulation and transducer parameters alone, even when no information about the individual is available.

<h3>Meeting proceedings</h3>
<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thanks for joining the plenary meeting of ITRUSST. Today's programme, we have one main topic which is the report from Safety working group. We will give the floor to Jean-Francoise in a moment to talk about derating pressure through the skull. I also want to start by giving opportunity to any of the other working groups. If there are urgent updates or communication that we should we consider. Anything from FUN22 we should discuss? <br><br>
</p>

    <h3>Update focus groups or FUN 22</h3>
<p>    
    <b>Tulika Nandi:</b> I would like to give a quick update of FUN22. Hopefully, you received an email with details about the FUN22 conference from September 26-28 in Mainz, Germany. The call for abstracts is already open and deadline is 21st of May. We hope to send feedback back to the people by the end of June. We would really appreciate if you Tweet about it or share it on other social media platforms. Also, if you have any feedback or questions, please do let us know.<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thanks. That is fantastic to hear so. We have someone operating the ITRUSST account on holidy, but we are actually going to hand over to Solenn. She will be joining the team shortly. <br>
    
    Quick check: Any of the other working groups, any urgencies we should know about? No? I give the floor to Jean-Francoise. Looking forward to it <br><br>
</p> 

    <h3>Presentation Safety working group: Recommendations on Mechanical safety</h3>
<p>
    <b>Jean-Francois Aubry:</b> This is part 2 of the recommendations on Mechanical safety. A briefly reminder of where we stood 6 months ago: Only physical safety, not neurophysiological at all so far. <br><br>
    
    <i>What we discussed 6 months ago</i><br><br>

    How to translate TUS to clinics in a safe way, with a reasonable timeline? What was proposed: By building on existing guidelines. What are the closest guidelines? Imaging guidelines. Back then, we discussed mechanical and thermal safety. <br>
    
    Concerning mechanical safety, we discussed the mechanical index (MI). First concern was, even though we are not using very short input -just one period-, we believe it is safe to assume that we could use this mechanical index to assist the mechanical safety. In order to use this for TUS, we can first start measuring the MI in water (no skull) with the MI formula. If MI below 1.9 in water, it means that it will be even further reduced by the skull bone and it should be safe to use your set-up. Maybe in the future, we can come up with a simple analytical model that takes into account the two bone/tissue interfaces and bone attenuation. And that we might also have soon a numerical model built based on simulations. We are looking forward to models proposed by the modeling group. <br>
    
    6 months ago, I was not sure if the Safety group could come up with a consensus and simple analytical model. But we made progress, and we would like to share with you a draft on how to estimate the maximum intensity transmitted through the skull.  <br><br>
    
    <i>Estimation of the maximum transmission through a simple skull model</i><br><br>

    We wanted a skull model, as simple and realistic as possible. We proposed 3 layer model with absorption including skin, skull and brain. In this model, we take into account the absorption inside the skull, the attenuation by the thickness of the skull and reflection waves. You end up with a complex transmission, but this is a simple case scenario in which we assume that the skull has a given thickness, and depending on that the transmission coefficient will vary. <br><br>
    
    <i> Transmission coefficient as a function of US frequency and skull thickness</i><br><br>
    
    There are currently some analytical solutions to this problem (Cobbold, 2006), but just assuming of one way incoming to the plate, then two waves in two directions, and one wave coming out the plate. Assuming no absorption, they provided a formula that gives you the transmission in energy. It also depends on the thickness of the plate, frequency, and wavelengths. If we would assume no absorption, do the calculations, we would yield the same formula as Cobbold's one (2006). This validates our approach.<br>
    
    We used data from Duck (1990), White et al. (2006), Robertson et al. (2017) and Leung et al. (2019) for the density, sound speed, impedance, and attenuatino for skin, skull, and brain. Many teams have been so far modelling the attenuation in the skull bone. From all models, if we take the minimum absorption by the most densed part of the cortical bone, we end up with attenuation of 83 Np/m/MHz. 83 is really the lowest one we have seen in the literature and this is also found by White et al. (2006), Robertson et al. (2017), and Leung et al. (2019). The worst case scenario would be with the smallest attenuation value. <br>
    
    The transmission coefficient is modelled as a function of ultrasound stimulation frequency and skull thickness. If the skull is very thick and the US frequency is high, the transmission is quite low. It increases when either the frequency or skull thickness is decreased. There are some peaks when the thickness of the bone is exactly multiple of wavelenghts you are using. Mostly, the thickness of the skull is larger than 1 mm. The perfect matching between thickness and US frequency does not happen at the time in the skull. This was the very first step: trying to find a model to estimate the transmission through the skull. <br><br>
    
    <i>Thickness computation</i><br><br>

    We know that the skull thickness varies depending on the part of the skull you focus on. We used interpolated CT scans and calculated the thickness of the bone. Thinner bone close to temporal. Highly increasing close to frontal. This is what we have been debating a lot in the Safety group: How to take this into account. Most of the time, we use large beams that average the effect of the skull of a given surface. Depending on the size of the transducer you are using to neuromodulate, you might either average the impact of th'e skull or the very sensitive thickness variations. <br>
    
    Pressure transmission depends on the location and frequency. Low frequency, US transmission higher for high US frequencies. There is also a high geometric variation. With several diameters of the transducers, we averaged the transmission of the diameter of the beam that is intersected by the skull. Here, we see again the impact of the size of the transducer and US frequency.<br><br>
    
    <i>Results</i><br><br>
    
    The endpoint of our small study is to provide a table for everyone of an estimation of maximum US pressure transmission calculated for 95% of all skull points (20 skulls, more than 1.4M points). For example, if you use a 200 kHz transducer with a 10 mm diameter, the pressure transmission would be close to 77%. <br>
    
    We did this for 20 skulls. When we look at the variation between 95% of each skull, we can see that they are pretty similar in terms of impact. Skulls vary of course in thickness, but when we look at the average and standard deviation of maximum transmission for all those 20 skulls, SD is not that big. <br>
    
    Maximum transmission for all skulls for all 95% of all measured skull points versus Average of maximum transmission for each skull: Pretty consistent. Compare the maximum transmission with actual measurements. In the literature, we looked at studies that had the following data: measured transmission coefficient, US beam dimater, and US frequency (White et al., 2016; Marsoc et al., 2013; Riis et al., 2021; Gimeno et al., 2019). Again, they are expected to be lower than our calculation, as we calculated the maximum transmission; this was the case. The trend is consistent, the values are higher for low frequencies and higher for smaller US beam diameter. It makes sense. <br>
    
    <i>We want to provide you realistic but conservative transmission</i><br><br>
    <i>Worst case scenario:</i><br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>* US waves are normal to the skull</li>
    <li>* Homogenous skull</li>
    <li>* Lowest attenuation in skull</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <i>Limits of this first study:</i>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>* Only 20 skulls</li>
    <li>* Only a few experimental dataset to compare</li>
    <li>* Second step: hundreds of skull from all ages, genders, ...?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We would like to submit the first paper alltogether at least for the method and for the first results and then collect more data in order to make this available for future Safety groups that will provide international recommendations.<br>

    Thank you for your attention. I would like to thank the Safety group again. This was clearly a team effort. It took us some time, I, of course, did not describe all models we developed. We started with no absorption, later included absorption,  then took into account that US frequency would play a role. This is the last model that we built for which we had a consensus. We are happy to discuss the model and table.<br><br>
</p>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> This is fantastic. I am super impressed. Before I open up the general discussion and questions, I would like to remind people of our structure; we work in working groups and we take a lot of time and care to come up with proposals. Now you have seen the proposal and now the next step here is that the whole ITRUSST in plenary can ask all questions to that proposal. Maybe there are slight adaptations needed, but very soon it will be suggested as a consensus proposal. If it would go out as an ITRUSST recommendation, then we will put an anonymous online vote . I just want to remind you that is the best moment to have questions or to give input on this proposal before we actually finilise it from the Safety group and put it down for vote. <br><br>
    
    <b>Philip Sabes:</b> I have a question. This variable thickness could have some lensing effect. I am wondering to what extent you concern about the fact that with variation of bone thickness and other kind of variation in the pathway you can get small hotspots. Is there any analytical or computational way to get the size of hotspots? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> You are right. There will always be the possiblity to use a numerical model. But first, we need to know how you are going to model the skull properties and validate the numerical model. In the past, what we noticed is that if you are using a focused transducer, it is much more likely it gets defocused by skull, so the transmission will be even lower than what we estimated.  Non-focused transducer could be a better option. With non-focused transducers, there might be re-focusing effect, so in that case you need to be pretty cautious in what you do. We might add a comment to this and may specify that this is for focused transducers. <br><br>
    
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> Congratulations Francoise and the rest of the team. When do you think it is going to be the first draft and when it is becoming available in a print format. It would be nice to compare to these formulas to how far we are. <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> That would be interesting. Even though I would expect to trust the simulations more than this, but at least it is a nice way to double check that the trend is correct.<br><br>
    
    <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> Really great stuff, I am very impressed. Two question: On your table, there is like an increasing trend from right to left except for the 100 kHz, is that due to some resonaning effect?<br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Good point. You can also see it in the peak plot showing transmission coefficient as a function of US frequency and skull thickness.  It truly depends on the thickness of the bone. For example, at the beginning, we developed first a model in which we assumed that the bone thickness was always higehr than 3 mm. That is what is mostly reported. Sometimes, it almost goes down to 2 mm, but not to 0 mm. That is the reason why the line in plot does not start at 0 mm thickness. On average, we see that there is slight increase around 200-300 kHz, I think it is true, it is not an artefact.<br><br>
    
    <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> My other questions is about the database of the skulls, about whether you handpicked them to have a range of different skull thickesses, STIs. I wonder how representative they are for the population. <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Those are all from people who donated their skulls to medicine. They are mostly more than 70 years old. This is what we need to do now: we need to collect young skulls, male, female, and also at some point we might need also to provide separated tables for temporal and occipital bone, as we expect that the results should be quite different. Refinement would be to separate different bones in skull and include more data, especially young and old patients. <br><br>
    
    <b>Seung-Schik Yoo:</b> Congratulations. Very impressive results. Quick questions: I saw beam diameter and it varies between 2-6 cm. How was the set up would be like? If it has a certain area, is it something that has been mapped along the beam pathway to get the maximum transmission? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> We would outrage the data for a given diameter, and then would average for a larger diameter, and then for all skull points. We tried to vary; for each point, we changed the diameter and average the data. <br><br>
    
    <b>Seung-Schik Yoo:</b> So that would mean it is kind of assuming that transmission  is perpendicular to the skull surface? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Yes, because we wanted also to be conservative. Hopefully what we provided here is the maximum transmission. We could also say that the maximum transmission is 1, but we wanted to provide some more information. That is the compromise we had. So what we provide here is what we expect to be the highest transmission for large population. Again, we did not take the maximum but 95%, because it is more representative. Also, based on the comparision with experimental data from literature, the magnitude is good -we are lower for sure, which is good. The more data we collect, the best it would be. If you have data, especially from US beam diameter, we would be happy to include. <br><br>
    
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Could we review the rationale for the choice of the attenuation? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> We looked into the literature in general, and noticed this (from Robertson et al. 2017) was the lowest that was reported. It was not a coincidence as in (the plot in) your paper is actually Robertson et al. (2017). They reported the same value. In our table, we have attenuation in Np/m/MHz, so we durated this value that you provided at 650 kHz to 1 MHz, such that this responds 83 Np/m/MHz. <br><br>
        
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> I was wondering how this approach can be expanded to a whole other transducer set ups, like whole-head set up.<br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> We could do it, the only thing is that if we take the entire head, then we can only have 1 measure point below the hemisphere. We would not be able to average this area. What we should report, is that when we report the big table, we should state this is for transducers up to 100 mm and more. If you use a higher diameter transducer, then you would average even more and those values will be even lower. When you increase the size of the transducer, it does not change much anymore. It will even decrease further down. We would say 100 mm and more diameter. <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> And what if you have many many small elements or non-circular or non-BOLD transducer arrays? How would you convert that to a diameter? Do you go to the 100 mm and more diameter or to the zero? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> That is a good question. For each individual transducer, you should use this value (0 mm diameter). Take at least into account the size of the transducer. Maybe what we should provide is a way to estimate the effectivity of the transducer.  <br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> If you have a slightly unconventional transducer, arrays, or set up, then you should use the 0 diameter (most conservative) or are you going to suggest how to transform your transducer shape into the effective diameter. Or for manufactur, please report effective diameter for your transducer array. <br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> All together, to me, the effective diameter is more than 100 mm. Of course you should take into account the size of 1 transducer. <br>
    
    <b>Douglas Christensen:</b> Good work Jean-Francoise. Do you have indication of the frequency dependence of your attenuation curve? Did you assume linear frequency dependence? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Yes, we assumed linear. It would be very simple to add any kind of power, modulation for dependency of absorption as a function of frequency. That is easy to put into the model. So far, we assumed linear. <br><br>
    
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> When do you expect to submit your publication? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> I would say pretty soon. But first we need to draft it to circulate along the Safety group. It should be quickly; the figures are there, we have the material, we need to write and make sure everyone in Safety committee agrees. Based on what we discussed today, we sure need to add some discussions about how to use this model and the limits of the model. We might include more general discussion again, those will not be recommendations but a consensus article. Maybe we might focus more on mechanical safety, and some words about mechanical index, and then provide the estimate of the transmission. Or, this needs to be discussed within the Safety group, we could just focus on just providing the model to estimate the maximum transmisson through the skull and providing this separately from the discussions we had about mechanical index. But it will be soon, in a month or two. <br><br>
    
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> This is the type of data that does give a very good basis for consensus standards. Very good foundation yet good experimental data. Many other standards are developed with lot less data behind it. This is a great foundation for at the next level a consensus paper, well referenced for guidance and beyond. Great job.<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Fantastic. Many people have highlighted that this is the contribution of the Safety group. I would like to thank Jean-Francoise and Kim. Kim has contributed a lot and it was fantastic to learn from the two of you, to see you working together and having this as an outcome. This recording and meeting minutes will be placed on the ITRUSST website. Reminder when you watch or read this: this a draft. Francoise: could we make the slides available?  <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Yes, that is possible, but we would like to get this published, so please keep this for you so far. There might be values in the tables that might change, not change much, but be careful. I am happy to make this available to the members of ITRUSST, each of you should keep this just as information and the publication will not take long. <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Earlier, there was a proposal that we could summarise the consensus proposal and publish it on the ITRUSST website under license even before a publication is out. Is that what you are hoping to do? <br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Let's wait 2 months till we are content. I would first focus on getting this paper out and then write a consensus on the rest.<br><br>
    
    <b>Dennis Parker *chat*:</b> Great work Francoise. Can you compare to the default derating?<br><br>
    
    <b>Jean-Francoise Aubry:</b> Sure, it will be almost 1. 95% I would say, because it is very thin and would be absorbed.  <br><br>
    
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> In TIC: there is 100% absorption in the skull. Either 0 or 100% depending on the model. This is type of information is really keen.<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> This is a good moment to wrap up. Thanks everyone for attending. Thanks Francoise and Kim for preparinig this. We will see each other next month when we get a talk from the Practice working group. Again, thanks all. We will be in touch soon <br><br>
</p>
