    Purpose: To establish recommendations and guidelines for equipment supporting focused ultrasonic neuromodulation, including primarily quality assurance and output checks, requirements for information and logging, as well as calibration and characterisation, (and a roadmap for future development and use).

<br><br>

<h3>short-term goals</h3>

<ul>
    <li>-To provide a hierarchy of equipment checks
    </li>
    
    <li>-To provide guidance on performing regular consistency checks on equipment</li>
    
    <li>-To recommend exclusion/inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers and patients (in collaboration with the Clinical focus group)</li>
</ul>

<h3>1 year goals (06/2022)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>-To continue discussion and provide guidance on the safe operation of equipment</li>
    
    <li>-To outline information needed to define source parameters for modelling purposes (in collaboration with the Planning focus group)</li>
