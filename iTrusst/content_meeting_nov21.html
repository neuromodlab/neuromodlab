<h3>Meeting proceedings</h3>
<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Today we are going to do a focus group update, start a discussion on the clinical aims and specifically on a clinical roadmap. Ellen and Chris have done an amazing job on leading the clinical group.  Are there any questions we should talk about before starting? <br><br>
    
    <b>Kim Butts Pauly:</b> Are we interested in starting a group for talking about phantoms. For example what is the best phantom to evaluate, image quality in the presence of the transducer, ARFI, skull imaging or the ability to get focus beyond the skull. If you are interested you can contact me and then we can start this discussion <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> these are some of Kims ideas, so contact her if you feel like contributing to this end<br>
    
    <i>Phantoms:</i>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Any MR phantom would do. things to think about are the pulse sequences and the stand-off (gel pad) and stand-off distances</li>
    <li>A gel with a reasonable stiffness</li>
    <li>Ideally with a skull. We could talk about best practices for storing and using skulls of course, one could just use a live human head</li>
    <li>We could suggest a gel like in 2, with an acrylic “skull” embedded which would be easy to store and maintain. Or, one could have a gel as in 2 with a space for waterbath which would contain a skull piece</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
    <i>Also need to talk about:</i>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preparing fresh skull pieces if they are extracted from animals</li>
    <li>Storing human skulls and preparing them for use (degassing)</li>
    <li>Absorbers to minimize reflections</li>
</ol>
<br>

<p>
    For the other focus groups, does anyone have another thing they would like to mention?<br><br>
    
    <b>Bradley Treeby:</b> Nothing to update from the planning group - it's been a busy term with teaching and other duties from my side. We will pick up again soon. <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Thank you for summarizing what probably every group felt after FUN21 and starting the teaching season. So let’s get started with the main topic. (shows slide)<br>
    
    <i>International expert group on transcranial ultrasonic stimulation safety and standards</i><br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>-	Reporting: standardised reporting for protocols, parameters, side effects</li>
    <li>-	Safety: biophysics, neurophysiology, behaviour; metrics and guidelines</li>
    <li>-	Practice: shared practices, standardized protocols, know-how guide</li>
    <li>-	Planning: stimulation, validation, image-guidance, parameter control</li>
    <li>-	Equipment: requirements, standardisation, metrology</li>
    <li>-	Clinical: clinical safety, interactions, trials, and roadmap to application</li>
    <li>-	Ethics: participation, impact, and future-ready roadmap</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> we have also talked about the main goals of the focus groups on the ITRUSST day. Something we noticed is that for example parameters for safety, for example, get input from safety, reporting and planning group. The need for separation is thus necessary. For example safety is not only immediate bio effects, but also neurophysiology. For clinical it is for example clinical safety, clinical trial guide and clinical roadmap. These aren’t the only three topics, clinical interactions, preclinical roadmap have also been discussed. Today we are discussing the clinical roadmap. For this I think it’s good to reflect back on the past decades and learn how the technique has evolved like Gail ter Haar sad. <br>
    
    <i>Clinical translation and application acceleration:</i>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>-	goal-oriented, application-informed, co-designed approach: at an early stage it’s relevant to have in mind what your goals  and applications are</li>
    <li>-	a unified approach, rather than everybody working on their own challenges</li>
    <li>-	focus, without exclusion</li>
    <li>-	accelerate the field, not a single application</li>
    <ul>
        <li>We need a roadmap, to define which indications is an excellent focus for example.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
    the special benefit is indicating why a specific indication is relevant, how they can inform each other and accelerate for other indications.
    
    <l>Clinical roadmap:</l>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>-	societal interest: most total good, prevention, early invention</li>
    <li>-	urgent economical interest: fast translation and application, focus on symptoms and late disease stages</li>
    <li>-	research and development interest: well-defined targets, good understanding of (clnical) mechanisms of action, reliable and fast (clinical) read-out</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b>: I would love to hear ideas about setting on the roadmap and learn about clinical indications. We can talk about the criteria of the roadmap, where should we focus on<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b>  With all the different groups working on different subjects, the challenges were kind of scattered. Most diseases we focus on are medication resistant disease, and also difficult to treat. Focused modulatory treatment is the combining theme instead of medication. And we would like to bring this together, but it’s a lot of work.<br><br>
    
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> We can learn from other fields. For example DBS, they got approval pretty soon and then it took many years before they got the next one and now they just started looking at stratification of patients, for example looking at biomarkers. Maybe we can frontend this by exploring secondary analysis during a clinical trial. Ultrasound feels like a potential pre-step, for which we need empirical evidence. For example ultrasound can be a criteria to be sensitive for DB<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> That’s a really good point, before surgery we try other trials first. We could think to push ultrasound as an option too. We might be stuck in the safety, which takes a lot of time. I wonder if we can have a uniform safety demonstration/publication so we can move beyond that. Each indication will get stuck in that, because you first have to show if it is safe for those patients<br><br>
    
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> Could this be a good time to get a general mood from other researchers on how much push back you have received. At this point it’s getting easier, but it’s still a struggle. A paper would be a perfect idea to deal with this.<br><br>
    
    <b>Robert Chen:</b> In terms of ethics approval. We have done normal subjects, and in a number of conditions as well. Initially we had to get approval, but ones we got approved we were able to get it without too much difficulty in the clinical population. And about the conditions, we should not forget the less common indications. We could have some sort of criteria on how to decide on which treatments to treat how. But a specific list would maybe not be the perfect way.<br><br>
    
    <b>Mark Schafer:</b> commenting about safety issue, we are blessed on diagnostic side, cursed on therapeutic side by our history. Fortunately at the levels we are using for neuromodulation effects it’s very safe. There is a very great safety marge, we could built on that data and set parameters for example.<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> proven safety in the field, with the history and mind to show where we are going now<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> original goal of iTRUSST was to be able to give more state of the art updates. And I agree with Robert to not forget about the non-common diseases. I hope there is a lot of expertise in indications. What can we learn from one which might be similar for the others. <br><br>
    
    <b>Tom Rheineck:</b> We could include the input from the insurance companies. Not because it’s more important then clinical development. But all of us have seen so many things with measurable outcomes compared to minimal invasive treatment. With indications, innervations are going to be required. By including that community early, not to try to push commercial but to show good education and data and we could use their input early on.<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> Clinically now we are still getting trouble to get DBS approved, so it’s a good point to think about this early<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Okay I want to move to a discussion a clinical roadmap: To start I would use movement disorders. I’m familiar with the circuits, we have fast and reliable readout symptoms, where you can get a near immediate feedback of clinical efficacy. It’s already been a target for DBS and focus ultrasound oblation. Is DBS the real analogy that we need for TUS? I’m worried we could get the same effects, and soon be leaving the low intensity domain and that we need higher intensity for continuous online stimulations. <br><br>
    
    <b>Robert Chen:</b> I think we should focus more on TMS then DBS, because we don’t have continuous stimulation. We have to rely on having some after effects. It might be closer to TMS, tDCS etc. We are not going to be curative, but more like a repeated treatment. We have a better opportunity then DBS because deeper structures can’t be reached by other techniques for example. We shouldn’t forget that there are a lot of other conditions apart from moving disorders.<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> this really reflects my part of thinking. Originally I was thinking about online paradigms with ongoing activity. Lately I’m moving towards offline protocols inducing plastic changes. You could for example consider epilepsy, with excitation inhibition balance. With focal epilepsy we even would have certain areas we would like to target. Here the aims are maybe not needing continuous device stimulation. We could go for more closed loop, recording sleep activity and intervene during. Or preventative interventions. I’m keen to hear response, should we focus on closed loop adaptive stimulating at certain time points, or trying to induce longer long lasting changes?<br><br>
    
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> we have moved everything to offline. It’s a simpler set up, where you see changes over a period of time and not while they are experiencing ultrasound.<br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> we are experiencing the same indeed, easier to set up. But it does have an impact on which clinical studies are most important to start with. Maybe optimizing direct effects would be interesting. But if we are highlighting this, we could make a call to the field to push to that direction. Should we focus on offline optimization, or in vivo and cell culture work?<br><br>
    
    <b>Samuel Pichardo:</b> the pre-DBS is one of the first things we would like for targets mapping. It’s also very crucial to go into the direction of the offline component. One interesting push back is precision, this can also counteract. For offline assessment we can still be 3 mm off target, where we lose subcortical structure specificity. If you need to target the same place over and over, this is going to be a challenge<br><br>
    
    <b>Ellen Bubrick:</b> maybe we should prove more clinical efficacy first. If it really works on patients. Even before this we need more neuro efficacy <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> Yes I hear your need for that precision. I’m marking that for many disorders the focus which is achievably is more than you would need or want. For example in psychiatric disorders we have treatments like TMS that are effective but not focal. The brain circuits you want to target can have a very different form. For many of our targets it’s hard to get the whole target, instead on one small point. <br><br>
    
    <b>Martin Monti:</b> I agree with that. I have gotten the same review as Sam, there is a mood we have to content with. In response to what we are doing. This means there is a general perception, which doesn’t match the pros we have as a tool. <br><br>
    
    <b>Lennart Verhagen:</b> we have reached the psychiatric disorders. I have for example been interested in anxiety. Where we can define the target where to go better. For example stratification, finding the right area to target. That’s relevant to DBS. If you compare movement, with on and off symptoms is easy, however with other disorders it can be a plastic effect which can take a month to stabilize. This could be a major challenge to allow fast enough test and optimization, but it can also be the whole thing we should be aiming for. We can learn a lot from taking DBS and TMS on how often we have to repeat our treatment for example. A good starting point to start our focus point. <br>
    
    We would like to use these ideas to help the discussion in the clinical work group. Don’t be afraid to get in touch with Ellen and this is the end of my list and overview. So if you have to add or comment, please let us know.<br>
    
    Next meeting is scheduled for reporting from the equipment group. We will send our usual announcement.<br><br>
    
    <b>Fidel Vila-Rodriguez:</b> I think it would be helpful for our group, to have time to provide an update in the next meetings. To have something where other people can give feedback on.<br><br>
