                                                My name is Benjamin Kop and I am a PhD student here in the Neuromodulation lab. While I enjoy stimulating my brain with books, music, films, and the like, I am always looking to stimulate other people’s brain in a more literal sense. During my PhD, I get to put this passion into practice in my research applying transcranial ultrasonic stimulation to the motor system. <br><br>

                                                My interest in the brain, neuromodulation, and the motor system was sparked during my bachelor’s degree in Psychology, specialized in Brain and Cognition. I further pursued these interests in a research master’s of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, where my work focused on functional motor cortical remapping in unilateral arm amputees using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Now, I am excited to be working with ultrasound and TMS to help establish the foundation of ultrasonic neuromodulation in humans, starting with its impact on motor cortical excitability.

                                                My name is Benjamin Kop and I am a PhD student here in the Neuromodulation lab. While I enjoy stimulating my brain with books, music, films, and the like, I am always looking to stimulate other people’s brain in a more literal sense. During my PhD, I get to put this passion into practice in my research applying transcranial ultrasonic stimulation to the motor system. <br><br>

                                                My interest in the brain, neuromodulation, and the motor system was sparked during my bachelor’s degree in Psychology, specialized in Brain and Cognition. I further pursued these interests in a research master’s of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, where my work focused on functional motor cortical remapping in unilateral arm amputees using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Now, I am excited to be working with ultrasound and TMS to help establish the foundation of ultrasonic neuromodulation in humans, starting with its impact on motor cortical excitability.
