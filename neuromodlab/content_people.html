                        My name is Benjamin Kop and I am a PhD student here in the Neuromodulation lab. While I enjoy stimulating my brain with books, music, films, and the like, I am always looking to stimulate other people’s brain in a more literal sense. During my PhD, I get to put this passion into practice in my research applying transcranial ultrasonic stimulation to the motor system.<br><br>

                        My interest in the brain, neuromodulation, and the motor system was sparked during my bachelor’s degree in Psychology, specialized in Brain and Cognition. I further pursued these interests in a research master’s of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, where my work focused on functional motor cortical remapping in unilateral arm amputees using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Now, I am excited to be working with ultrasound and TMS to help establish the foundation of ultrasonic neuromodulation in humans, starting with its impact on motor cortical excitability.

                        My name is Soha and I am a PhD student in Lennart Verhagen's Cognitive Neuromodulation lab and Hanneke den Ouden’s Learning & Decision-making lab. I completed my master's in Medical Neurobiology at Radboud University. I had the greatest difficulty choosing between different tracks and courses at the time, and therefore also specialized in cognitive neuroscience.  That said, one of my biggest weaknesses is making decisions. Naturally, I thought it would be a good idea to study this trait in humans. I am interested in understanding how our motivations guide our actions in often seemingly irrational ways. To do that, I am using a highly promising brain stimulation tool. I will focus on unraveling the role of the striatum (a deep brain structure) in motivational decision making by non-invasively modulating this nucleus with transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (pretty cool, right?). In my free time (let's pretend we know what that is), I love to cook, run, and paint - I even crafted a children's book. I probably know everything there is to know about the Kardashians and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Other than that, I like my coffee dark and my beer in all shades. Hit me up if you ever want to discuss ultrasonic stimulation, decision making or superhero movies!

Now I am excited to be part of a team at the forefront of safe transcranial neuromodulation here at the Donders Institute in Nijmegen. I am trying to modulate subcortical activity in awake and asleep humans to hopefully reach my ultimate goal, which is to understand how lucid dreaming works.

                        Bob received his MSc in Psychology (Cum laude) from the University of Amsterdam in 2015 and then went on to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience (Cum Laude) in the EPAN lab under supervision of Prof. Karin Roelofs and Prof. Ivan Toni. During his PhD he studied the role of the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) in emotional-action control by combining several neuroimaging (MEG, fMRI, MRS, DTI) and neuro-modulation techniques (tACS). These techniques were employed to study the way prefrontal cortex is able to bias emotional actions through its structural connections with areas related to emotional processing; aPFC’s influence on action selection through long-range synchronization with motor-related areas; and the role of neurotransmitters that might support communication within this neuronal circuit. Combined, these studies aimed to provide an account of the anatomical constraints of the emotional-action control circuit, its electrophysiological properties and neurochemical profile, and causally manipulated network-level characteristics. <br><br>

                        As a postdoctoral researcher Bob is a part of the Innovative Neurotechnology for Society (INTENSE) consortium, where he continues to study mechanisms of affective behavior, focusing on approach/avoidance decision making. In this project he will work towards a closed-loop neuro-intervention system aimed to detect preparation of avoidance actions, and consequently perturb avoidance behavior using Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation targeted at the amygdala.

My diverse range of interests first drew me to study Artificial Intelligence at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen and later got me into the Cognitive Neuroscience master at Radboud University. I am now in the last year of the master and work as an intern in the brain stimulation lab, carrying out a research project on the effects of Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation on the human amygdala during fear learning. When I’m not stimulating any amygdalae, I enjoy long nature walks, dancing and thrift shopping.
