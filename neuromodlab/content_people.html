                Hey! My name is Brittany and I am the project coordinator of the Verhagen lab, or for short: the lab shrink. During my bachelor's degree in Psychology (UU) and my master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience (RU) I got triggered by our fascinating brain and how it works. So, I am very proud to be part of the amazing work we do in the lab and even more excited to let others know what it is that we do and why that is interesting. Becoming a science communicator is a dream that I cherish. <br> <br>
                When I am not spamming members of the lab with thousands of messages and reminders, you can probably find me in the lab helping out with research. After (or before) work, you will probably find me in the gym. Other than that, I enjoy spending time with friends, writing, reading, teaching Psychology classes, and giving talks. <br> <br>

                        My name is Benjamin Kop and I am a PhD student here in the Neuromodulation lab. While I enjoy stimulating my brain with books, music, films, and the like, I am always looking to stimulate other people’s brain in a more literal sense. During my PhD, I get to put this passion into practice in my research applying transcranial ultrasonic stimulation to the motor system.<br><br>

                        My interest in the brain, neuromodulation, and the motor system was sparked during my bachelor’s degree in Psychology, specialized in Brain and Cognition. I further pursued these interests in a research master’s of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, where my work focused on functional motor cortical remapping in unilateral arm amputees using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Now, I am excited to be working with ultrasound and TMS to help establish the foundation of ultrasonic neuromodulation in humans, starting with its impact on motor cortical excitability.

                    My name is Sjoerd Meijer and I’m a PhD student in the lab passionate about circuit-level neuroimaging and neuromodulation. I aim to discover how brain stimulation can alleviate anxiety in humans. I use a combination of state-of-the-art brain stimulation techniques, behavioural tasks, and functional neuroimaging to map causal brain-behaviour relationships. I use transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS), a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique that enables us to target the source of anxiety – deep in the brain. Further, I investigate the potential anxiolytic effects of dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on approach-avoidance behaviour in social anxiety. My research could open up new avenues for anxiety disorders therapies. <br> <br> 
                    
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing field hockey, piano, and going to the movies and concerts. <br> <br>
                    
                    Pre-packed sandwiches are my guilty pleasure. Not sure how to treat that with brain stimulation, yet.

                        My name is Soha and I am a PhD student in Lennart Verhagen's Cognitive Neuromodulation lab and Hanneke den Ouden’s Learning & Decision-making lab. I completed my master's in Medical Neurobiology at Radboud University. I had the greatest difficulty choosing between different tracks and courses at the time, and therefore also specialized in cognitive neuroscience.  That said, one of my biggest weaknesses is making decisions. Naturally, I thought it would be a good idea to study this trait in humans. I am interested in understanding how our motivations guide our actions in often seemingly irrational ways. To do that, I am using a highly promising brain stimulation tool. I will focus on unraveling the role of the striatum (a deep brain structure) in motivational decision making by non-invasively modulating this nucleus with transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (pretty cool, right?). In my free time (let's pretend we know what that is), I love to cook, run, and paint - I even crafted a children's book. I probably know everything there is to know about the Kardashians and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Other than that, I like my coffee dark and my beer in all shades. Hit me up if you ever want to discuss ultrasonic stimulation, decision making or superhero movies!

                        I received my MSc in Psychology (Cum laude) from the University of Amsterdam in 2015 and then went on to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience (Cum Laude) in the EPAN lab under supervision of Prof. Karin Roelofs and Prof. Ivan Toni. During my PhD I studied the role of the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) in emotional-action control by combining several neuroimaging (MEG, fMRI, MRS, DTI) and neuro-modulation techniques (tACS). These techniques were employed to study the way prefrontal cortex is able to bias emotional actions through its structural connections with areas related to emotional processing; aPFC’s influence on action selection through long-range synchronization with motor-related areas; and the role of neurotransmitters that might support communication within this neuronal circuit. Combined, these studies aimed to provide an account of the anatomical constraints of the emotional-action control circuit, its electrophysiological properties and neurochemical profile, and causally manipulated network-level characteristics. <br><br>

                        As a postdoctoral researcher I am a part of the Innovative Neurotechnology for Society (INTENSE) consortium, where I continues to study mechanisms of affective behavior, focusing on approach/avoidance decision making. In this project I will work towards a closed-loop neuro-intervention system aimed to detect preparation of avoidance actions, and consequently perturb avoidance behavior using Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation targeted at the amygdala.
